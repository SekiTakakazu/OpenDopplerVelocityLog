# OpenDopplerVelocityLog

The ODVL is one step to the project OpenSIdeScanSonar. Since I met Anty (he is the founder of the Amethyst project, an open source AUV. You'll find it under https://beobachtung3d.com/ I had this idea in mind to support his great project with something useful. I allways was  interested in surveying the underwater world and so I think it's  consequent to build a piece of tech wich is able to picture and monitor the ground. 

I checked the market and there are plenty of commercial systems. You can find professional stuff but also really reliable systems for fishfinding. But I wanted to diy a system. After a few weeks of reading papers and searching the net I cam to the conclusion that the learning curve is really steep. And so I started a side project: the DopplerVelocityLog (DVL)
